# guid-slurp
A Podcasting 2.0 GUID to RSS feed URL resolver with distributed databases


## Running with Docker (and scissors)

### Instructions

Get yourself a fresh new machine with Docker already installed and working.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianoflondon/guid-slurp.git
```

```bash
cd guid-slurp
````

Now you need to edit the `.env.sample` file and rename it `.env`.

Then run this if you wish to have a fully public API resolver (involving Traefik):

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Alternatively for a local version only:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-no-traefik.yaml up --build -d
```


If my calculations are correct, when you hit 88 MPH... oh, wait, no.

If everything is working properly, you can watch progress of startup with this:

```bash
docker compose logs -f | grep -v "guid-slurp-mongodb"
```

On first launch it will have to download the 1.4GB Database and then convert that into a smaller database.

Various steps will be shown in the logs. In addition the reverse proxy Traefik will start up and try to sort out SSL certs. The next version of these docs will hopefully have more info on this.

When all is settled down you should see something like this:

```log
guid-slurp-start    | ðŸŸ¢Created collection of duplicatesGuidUrl
guid-slurp-start    | Finished database finalisation: 897.155 s
```

The API front end will then be available on `http://your_machine_ip:7777/docs` and on the internet depending on the settings you put in the .env file.


### Logs and stuff

To see the containers you have running use this:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something like this:
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                    NAMES

```

To inspect logs from any of these use:

```bash
docker logs guid-slurp-startup -f
```

The startup script will run and then disappear. The others should remain running and will restart if the machine reboots.

I haven't written an automated way of updating the database every week... stay tuned!

### Traefik SSL certs

The first time you start up the containers, the default is to use a staging server for SSL certs. Before running with production you will need to redirect the DNS of whatever domain name you want to use to the public IP of the server you're on. You set this public domain name in the `.env` file `EXTERNAL_API_DOMAIN` setting.

Then startup and look at the Traefik logs:

```bash
docker logs guid-slurp-traefik -f
```

It should look something like this:

```log
guid-slurp-traefik  | time="2023-05-30T12:54:21Z" level=info msg="Starting provider aggregator aggregator.ProviderAggregator"
guid-slurp-traefik  | time="2023-05-30T12:54:21Z" level=info msg="Starting provider *file.Provider"

guid-slurp-traefik  | time="2023-05-30T12:54:21Z" level=info msg="Starting provider *acme.Provider"

guid-slurp-traefik  | time="2023-05-30T12:54:21Z" level=info msg="Starting provider *acme.Provider"

```

Hopefully if you see something like that without any errors, you can move on and try to use a production server for your SSL certs.

A quick note about *Cloudflare*: if you're running behind Cloudflare, I think Cloudflare will accept staging certificates and then present real certificates to your users so you can leave it at this stage.

You should be able to view your site at https://your-domain-name.com/docs but you will get a certificate warning. If you push through and view the certificate you should see something like this:

```
Common Name (CN)	TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT
Organization (O)	<Not Part Of Certificate>
Organizational Unit (OU)	<Not Part Of Certificate>
```

If you do have this, it means you can probably switch to the `production` SSL cert server. Edit the `.env` file:

```bash
# Run for the first time in 'staging' to avoid rate limits
# If everything is ok, change to 'production'
CERT_RESOLVER_STATUS='production'
```

And then restart everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And if everything goes according to plan you should be able to access the API Docs without any SSL warnings.

# Server Specifications

I'd suggest 2GB of RAM is a minimum but having said that, I have managed to run this on a 1GB box, though the startup will take a few minutes.
